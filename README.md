# nii-rs

This is a Rust-based library focused on efficiently reading and saving medical imaging files in NIfTI-1 format (.nii.gz). Built as a wrapper around nifti-rs, it provides interfaces similar to SimpleITK and Nibabel, making it easy for users to get started. 

In addition to the native Rust API, Python bindings are provided, enabling seamless integration into the Python ecosystem. Whether you're a Rust developer or a Python user, you can effortlessly handle NIfTI files, benefiting from high performance and cross-language support.
